#Week 2 Response

date 9-4-18

## Overview

This week was all about finishing the setup of the web design programs will will be using in Creative Coding 120. I focused mostly on familiarizing myself with the text editor, praciticing how to edit and save files. I Connected my local repo to the remote repot on [Github.com](https://github.com/jballas/120-work) Then I learned how to commit to Github desktop and view different versions of the file in history, before commiting to master and pushing to the remote repo. Lastly I created a markdown template file to use on all my future homework and used it for the first time in this week's readme.md 

## Projects

- hw-2/test1.txt
- hw-2/test2.txt

## Assignment
Write a Weekly Response, titled readme.md, sync to Github.com and submit the link on the moodle forum.

## Step by Step Weekly Report

I am working on Windows PC. Previously I downloaded the commandline Git Bash, the text editor Visual Studio Code and the Github desktop. This week it was important to get familiar with all these programs and practicing connecting and syncing files. 

### Commiting Files on Github Desktop

1. Edit files in text editor: Visual Studio Code
2. Save it
3. View Changes in Github Desktop
4. Write a summary, and a description.
5. Select 'Commit to master'
6. Push to Github.com

## Problems or Issues this week

I noticed something odd in my history of test1.txt. When I first uploaded the file it did not save the entire file, but only one line. I had extra lines with my name on them, and  I'd just removed before commiting, which it also shows in my history. 

I decided to do a test2.txt to see if I could recreate this.

## Specific questions/concerns for next week

Although I have gotten the hang of the text editor, and how everything syncs. I am unsure about some of the specific details, like what colors mean on the sidebar. I think if it is green it means I still have to commit the file.

## Other Classmates Issues/discussions

## Concludsion

Now that I understand how **Github Desktop** works as a visual control system, I want all my programs to have this feature, my writing, my graphic design, basicially everything needs to have a cloud backup.
