# Week 3 Response

9-11-18

## Overview

This week felt very empowering. For the first time I felt like I was programming by myself, and knew what I was doing, and not just mimicking someone else's guidelines. I tried to learn how to code before, and a few years ago made a Hello World program, which is traditionally the first program everyone creates. Perhaps working with the p5.js canvas made a difference too. To sum it up, this week I used JavaScript language and created a static webpage.

## Projects

- 01_hello-word
- 02_hellow-world
- 04_canvas
- hw-3/sketch.js
    - Hello World final sketch
    - live static webpage

## Weekly Report

We received an empty-example folder this week so we could program in p5.js right away without having do more setup of files, such as the sketch file and index file and connecting those to the p5 library.

This allowed me to focus on learning the language of JavaScript, and the basic requirements for a JavaScript program.

P5.js programs typically have a set-up function at the top and then a draw function below for the actual drawing. Comments provide more information about your project to you or to anyone else who reads the code.

### How to program in 5 easy steps

1. New folder created with empty sketch.js, and index.html, etc.
2. Added setup function and created canvas size 
    - canvas size in p5.js defaults to 100 x 100 px
3. Added draw function with text 'Hello World' in a specific position
4. Customized background color and font style and size
5. commit and push to GitHub.com

### Static Webpage

After saving my repo to GitHub, the next step was to make it a live webpage; this involved going under settings and activating my GitHub pages. GitHub generously provides server space.

## Problems or Issues this week

I took a break after finishing part 1 of this week's lesson. I like to give myself a few days to process everything I learn, and then when I come back I review it with fresh eyes. I usually finish up my homework on Tuesday morning. However on 9-11-18 around 9am GitHub was down. I couldn't access my repo. According to the GitHub status page they knew about the issue and were in the process of fixing it. I had to wait an hour until I got access, but whenever a website goes down, it makes me panic. What if it never comes back? I couldn't even access the issues forum. Luckily it resolved itself, and I still had the rest of the day to finish my homework and upload the webpage.

When customizing my Hello World program at first I could not change the font style and sizing. Then I realize I was putting the textSize and textFont in the wrong section, under the draw function and it need to go above in the setup. Then it worked like I wanted it too.

## Specific questions/concerns for next week

Next week we get deeper into drawing with code. While working on the simple Hello World text program I immediately wanted to animate the text. I looked through the p5 library at examples, but felt very confused and uncertain. Especially when I looked at the mouseMoved function. The reference page mentioned variables and the values. I couldn't figure out what to do with those values, or whether I could use this to make my text move at all. In the end I only adjusted the font size and style.

## Concludsion

Programming in JavaScript is intimidating, but understanding the logic behind it makes it much easier. Knowing a program begins with the setup with the drawing after that makes sense. However, I'm skeptical about drawing using only number values to make shapes, and I wonder whether this will feel as meaningful as taking a pen to paper. It seems like more work, and too many numbers, to do something as simple as draw a shape, or a house or portrait, but if we can animate or create movement as well, then that appeals to me. Ultimately, I want to create a story. I love writing novels, and want to do something related to one of my novels for my final project. I don't know how yet.
