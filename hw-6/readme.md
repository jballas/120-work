## Practicing with Belzier curve

My first day of practicing with the math I pulled some previous code which had lines and a belzier curve. Last week I did a simple addition and it created a simple pattern that quickly ran out of room. So, by adding in different restritions, the modulo is very handy, and some random numbers I was able to make a much more interesting evolving pattern. Not sure if it counts as an algorithim art. Figuring out how to make the alpha values random was tricky, but I referred to Dr. Musick's code to get my variables to work inside a ```fill()```.

**Todo **
- How you mirror something. Can you use the scale feature? Or perhaps invert it somehow? 
- Do I need to make my triangles smaller to make it evolve into an algorithum pattern? 
- Review Random walking types again
