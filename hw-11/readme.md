## Overview

## Projects

- Popcorn

## Assignment

## Weekly Report

### Day 1 notes

I'm going to make popcorn.
As an object it needs the following:

Attributes

- seed shape
- popped shape

Methods

- shaking (jumping, jittering, or heating up)
- popping (expanding or exploding)

### DAY 2 Notes

I started by making the shape of my seed, and getting it to jump randomly, but each seed needs to have a different location and random movement. I think I can accomplish this by putting the seeds location into an array, and movement.

But how does this work from within an object class?
