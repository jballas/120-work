# Week 5 Response

date 9-25-18

## Overview

This week we animated our sketches. I've been excited for this part from the beginning. Finally some movement. I applied variables to my code and explored various way to use the mouseX and mouseY parameters.

## Projects

- pyramid
- timelapse sketch

## Assignment

Create a sketch that moves, or an absract image that changes over time.

### Practicing variables and simple math

In my first experiment I made a 3D pyramid, and it surprised me when I first tested it. It stuck to my mouse! At first I struggled with making the shapes, but using variables was tremdously helpful in getting all the corners of the pyramid to align. Next I used the mouseX and mouseY on just the top of the pyramid and that let me animate it and move it around my canvas. When designing it I used alpha values on three of the sides, so it showed off the 3D shape. I was super impressed by how it all came together.

My next experiment was to recreate the background color changing, and I struggled with where to put my background variable. The Variable Scope still confuses me.

Here is a link to the practice experiment.

### Sketch

I made a sketch with a building and mountains and then I added a sunrise. My car is controlled by mouseX and my clouds by mouseY parameters. The sun just drifts off to the left and disappears.

Most of my concern was making the scene dynamic. I couldn't discover a method to make the sky change color, so adding the clouds gave it a a sense of time. With my cars attached to my
