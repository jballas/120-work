### Practicing variables and simple math

I made a 3D pyramid, and it worked surprisingly well for just an experiment. First I struggled with making the shapes, but using variables was tremdously helpful in getting all the corners of the pyramid to align. Next I used the mouseX and mouseY on just the top of the pyramid and that let me animate it and move it around my canvas. When designing it I used alpha values on three of the sides, so it showed up the 3D shape. I was super impressed by how it all came together.

My next experiment was to recreate the background color changing, and I struggled with where to put my background variable. The Variable Scope still confuses me.
