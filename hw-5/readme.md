### Practicing variables and simple math

![screenshot of Pyramid experiment](screenshot_pyramid.PNG)

I made a 3D pyramid, and it worked surprisingly well for just an experiment. First I struggled with making the shapes, but using variables was tremdously helpful in getting all the corners of the pyramid to align. Next I used the mouseX and mouseY on just the top of the pyramid and that let me animate it and move it around my canvas. When designing it I used alpha values on three of the sides, so it showed up the 3D shape. I was super impressed by how it all came together.

My next experiment was to recreate the background color changing, and I struggled with where to put my background variable. The Variable Scope still confuses me.

###
Sketch #1 

I made a sketch with a building and mountains and then I added a sunrise. My car is controlled by mouseX and my clouds by mouseY parameters. The sun just drifts off to the left and disappears. So, I guess this qualifies as changing over time. I'm still not quite satisfied with this. I don't feel like I've really explored the ideas this week. I'm going to experiment some more with abstract shapes and overlapping colors.
