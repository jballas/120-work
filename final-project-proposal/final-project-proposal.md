### Word Exercise

"word exercise
You can express the meaning of a word or
an idea through the spacing, sizing, and
placement of letters on the page."

### Text Exercise

"Text expercise
Interpret the meaning of a text
by manipulating the alignment of lines and columns
(flush left, flush right, justified, and centered)."

### Grid Exercise

"Grid exercise
Position text within a modular grid. Create variations in order to see the range of possibilities within a system."

## My Process

I am a writer. I write novels. I self publish them under the name Ava Clary. That is my passion.

Within the writing world is a ongoing debate about whether you Outline or are a Pantser. I am a pantser, meaning I write by the seats of my pants. I go into my projects with an idea I want to explore, or a character I'm curious about. I know the general premise of the first few chapters, and maybe a few exciting events later on, but mosty I don't know anything about the story until I write it. Then I revise and polish it, and eventually it becomes a story I will publish. The important part of this process is the mystery, and not knowing. Instead, I am inspired in unpredictable ways.

I believe this aspect of my art process is here in coding as well. Whenever I meticulously plan and focus too narrowly on my coding project, I limit myself to such a degree I can't make progress. I don't want to limit myself. I want to explore and find something delightful.

I don't have a plan. I have ideas.
