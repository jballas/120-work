## Summary

For my final project I would like to submit an p5.js sketch that explores Typography.

## Inspirations 

Paula Scher, graphic designer.



## My Process

I am a writer. I write novels. I self publish them under the name Ava Clary. That is my passion. I am currently

Within the writing world is a debate between Outlining and Pantsers. I am a pantser, meaning I write by the seats of my pants. I go into my projects with an idea I want to explore, or a character I'm curious about. I know the general premise of the first few chapters, and maybe a few exciting events later on, but mosty I don't know anything about the story until I write it. Then I revise and polish it, and eventually it becomes a story I will publish. The important part is the experimenting, and letting myself be inspired by what is happening in the story.

I believe this aspect of my art process is here in coding as well. Whenever I meticulously plan and focus too narrowly on my project, I limit myself to such a degree I can't make progress. I don't want to limit myself. I want to explore and find something delightful. 

I don't have a plan. I have ideas.
