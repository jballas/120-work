### notes after Practicing shapes

I experimented with shapes, and pulled out my calculator for the first time to be precise when placing my column of ellpises. I confused myself at first about the xy location parameters, as opposed to the width and height parameters. But even my mistakes are interesting. The Quad is intimiadting, using 8 different parameters. I winged it and then played around until I had an hourglass shape that stretches off the screen.

### notes after practicing color

Adding color with the fill() function and the stroke() function gave me some headaches. The order of operations confused me because when I placed a strokeWeight function below the ellipses it still applied the heavier weight to everything. I fixed this by adding in more details. The transparency gave me grief too, since I got confused about when to use commas and when to leave them out of a fuction.

Next up Portrait practice. I'm going to do a rough draft based on a idea I have and then I'll work on my final. Breaking down into sections for the head, eye, nose, etc. Keeping and eye on the order of the shapes will be tricky.
