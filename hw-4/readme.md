# Week 2 Response

date 9/18/18

## Overview

This week focus was on learning the p5.js computer language. We studied basic shapes, such as ellipse, rectangles and arcs. We learned how to add color to these, and to manipulate their size, shape and placement on the canvas and the importance of order of operations in your code. This was put to practice by making a self portrait.

## Step by Step Weekly Report

### Drafting a p5.js Portrait in 5 steps

1. Practice making shapes
2. sketch mockup of your portrait (I used a photoediting program)
3. review mockup for basic shapes you can recreate in code
4. code your shapes beginning from the background and moving forward
5. add proper color as RGB or HEX

### Practice

First, I began with a study each primative shape. I needed to learn what the code created, the input parameters and how to use it.

- arc()
- ellipse()
- line()
- point()
- quad()
- rect()
- triangle()

#### notes after Practicing shapes

I experimented with shapes, and pulled out my calculator for the first time to be precise when placing my column of ellpises. I confused myself at first about the xy location parameters, as opposed to the width and height parameters. But even my mistakes are interesting. The Quad is intimiadting, using 8 different parameters. I winged it and then played around until I had an hourglass shape that stretches off the screen.

#### notes after practicing color

Adding color with the fill() function and the stroke() function gave me some headaches. The order of operations confused me because when I placed a strokeWeight function below the ellipses it still applied the heavier weight to everything. I fixed this by adding in more details. The transparency gave me grief too, since I got confused about when to use commas and when to leave them out of a fuction.

Next up Portrait practice. I'm going to do a rough draft based on a idea I have and then I'll work on my final. Breaking down into sections for the head, eye, nose, etc. Keeping and eye on the order of the shapes will be tricky.

### Mockup and Bright Face

A portrait means to mean a closeup. I chose a selfie I took earlier this year during a trip to the Netherlands. It more dramatic and I'm looking off to the side. I changed the contrast, and added a filter to make it 'watercolor' style. My goal was to get at the basic shapes of my face.

Once I had the mockup, I reviewed the shapes, and came up with a lovely portrait with bright colors. I almost prefer this one to the more poster-style I ended up with. I reminds me of a cartoon.

## Problems or Issues this week

After Dr. Musick's warning about errors, the first time my preview went blank I didn't panic. I made sure I had all the commas in the right place, and occasionally I'd forget to capitalize a strokeWeight, or I'd mispell translate. It was always little details, but I was able to problem-solve myself.

Most ofo the struggle this week was with the art. I'm still learning basic art, and drawing techniques, so this was excellent practice on studying shape, shadows and highlights. I could not get the chin of my portrait to work out. This was one of my attempts.

Eventually, I managed to use only ellipses to make a shadow along the left side of my face and somehow managed to make a chin.
